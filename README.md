# The hastuzeit Repository

This is the repository for the site of the student magazine at the University of Halle, Germany.

## The WordPress Theme

The folder `wphastuzeit/` contains the active WordPress theme as seen on [hastuzeit.de](http://hastuzeit.de). Please note this is a highly customized theme which wasn't written with portability in mind. Using this on your own site probably won't work and there's no intention to a make the theme work on other sites than [hastuzeit.de](http://hastuzeit.de).

## Design Files

The folder `design/` contains all design files used within the theme or for other online representations of the hastuzeit, like avatar images for [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hastuzeit) & [Facebook](https://facebook.com/hastuzeit)
